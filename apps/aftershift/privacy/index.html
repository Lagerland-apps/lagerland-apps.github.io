overview: >
  AfterShift is designed to help shift workers recover better by understanding
  sleep, timing, and routines.
  Privacy is a core part of the app’s design.
  This policy explains what information AfterShift processes,
  how it is used, and the choices you have.

data_collection: >
  AfterShift processes the information you choose to enter into the app,
  such as work shifts (start and end times, shift type, optional notes),
  preferences (for example target sleep duration, commute time,
  caffeine sensitivity, and nap tolerance),
  and optional manual logs like naps or caffeine entries.
  If you choose to connect Apple Health, AfterShift may read sleep data
  such as sleep sessions and sleep stages from HealthKit.
  AfterShift does not collect data for advertising purposes.

data_storage: >
  By default, all data is stored locally on your device.
  If you enable iCloud sync, your data is securely stored in your personal
  iCloud account and synced across your devices using Apple’s infrastructure.
  AfterShift does not operate its own external servers to store your
  personal shift or sleep data.

third_parties: >
  AfterShift does not use third-party analytics, advertising,
  or tracking services.
  Apple may process limited data as part of services you choose to use,
  such as Apple Health, local notifications, in-app purchases,
  iCloud sync, or Apple Intelligence features supported by your device.

sensitive_data: >
  If you connect Apple Health, AfterShift may read health-related data
  such as sleep information through HealthKit.
  Health data is used only to generate insights and summaries inside the app.
  AfterShift does not sell, share, or use health data for advertising,
  and health data is not transmitted to third-party marketing services.

children: >
  AfterShift is not directed at children under the age of 13,
  and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

changes: >
  We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
  Any changes will be reflected on this page,
  and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.
