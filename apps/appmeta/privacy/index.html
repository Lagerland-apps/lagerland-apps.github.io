overview: >
  AppMeta is designed to help developers manage App Store metadata safely and efficiently.
  Your app data and credentials are your business.
  This policy explains what information AppMeta processes,
  how it is used, and the choices you have.

data_collection: >
  AppMeta processes information you explicitly provide or access through the app,
  such as app metadata (names, descriptions, keywords, URLs),
  localization content, version information,
  in-app purchase and subscription metadata,
  and related configuration data retrieved from App Store Connect.
  This information is used only to provide AppMeta’s core functionality,
  including local editing, diff previews, and syncing changes to App Store Connect.

data_storage: >
  By default, all app metadata and workspace data is stored locally on your Mac.
  AppMeta does not operate its own servers for storing your data.
  App Store Connect API credentials are stored securely in the macOS Keychain.
  If you choose to use macOS or iCloud features such as backups,
  your data may be included according to your system settings.

third_parties: >
  AppMeta does not use third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
  AppMeta communicates directly with Apple’s App Store Connect API
  to fetch and update your app data.
  Apple may process limited data as part of services you choose to use,
  such as App Store Connect, Keychain, and in-app purchases.

children: >
  AppMeta is intended for professional developers and is not directed
  at children under the age of 13.
  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

changes: >
  We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
  Any changes will be reflected on this page,
  and the effective date will be updated accordingly.
