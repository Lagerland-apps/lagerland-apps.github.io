overview: >
  AppMeta Pulse is designed to help developers quickly understand the
  performance of their apps on the App Store.
  Privacy is a core part of the app’s design.
  This policy explains what information AppMeta Pulse processes,
  how it is used, and the choices you have.

data_collection: >
  AppMeta Pulse processes limited information required to display
  App Store performance data.
  This includes App Store Connect credentials you provide
  (such as issuer ID, key ID, and private key),
  which are used only to authenticate with Apple’s official
  App Store Connect API.
  AppMeta Pulse does not collect personal information for advertising
  or marketing purposes.

data_storage: >
  App Store Connect credentials are stored securely on your device
  using the Apple Keychain.
  Performance data retrieved from App Store Connect
  (such as revenue, downloads, subscriptions, and trends)
  is cached locally on your device to enable fast access.
  AppMeta Pulse does not operate its own external servers
  to store your App Store data.

third_parties: >
  AppMeta Pulse does not use third-party analytics,
  advertising, or tracking services.
  Apple may process limited data as part of services you choose to use,
  such as App Store Connect APIs, local notifications,
  in-app purchases, background app refresh,
  or iCloud device backups if enabled.

sensitive_data: >
  AppMeta Pulse does not process health data,
  location data, or other sensitive personal information.
  App Store performance data is used solely to present
  read-only insights within the app.
  AppMeta Pulse does not sell, share, or use data
  for advertising or profiling purposes.

children: >
  AppMeta Pulse is not directed at children under the age of 13,
  and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

changes: >
  We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
  Any changes will be reflected on this page,
  and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.
