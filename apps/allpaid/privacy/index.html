  without stress or clutter.
  Privacy is a core part of the app’s design.
  This policy explains what information AllPaid processes,
  how it is used, and the choices you have.

  AllPaid processes the information you choose to enter into the app,
  such as bill names, amounts, due dates, recurrence settings,

  If you enable App Lock, biometric authentication
  (such as Face ID or Touch ID) is handled entirely by your device.
  AllPaid does not collect data for advertising purposes.

  using Apple’s infrastructure.
  AllPaid does not operate external servers to store your personal
  financial or billing data.

third_parties: >
