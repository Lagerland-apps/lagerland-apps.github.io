title: "Privacy Policy"
app_name: "WanderWiki"

overview: >
  WanderWiki is designed to be calm, simple, and privacy-respecting.
  The app focuses on content discovery rather than user profiling.
  Most usage happens without accounts, tracking, or personal identifiers.
  This policy explains what information WanderWiki processes,
  how it is used, and the choices you have.

data_collection: >
  WanderWiki does not require you to create an account and does not
  collect personal information such as your name, email address,
  or contacts.
  The app processes limited on-device data related to your app usage,
  such as saved articles, likes, selected interests, and reading state.
  Search queries are used only to retrieve relevant Wikipedia articles
  and are not stored or associated with your identity.
  WanderWiki may also process limited technical data related to
  app reliability, optional diagnostics, and in-app purchases.

data_storage: >
  App data such as saved articles, preferences, and reading state
  is stored locally on your device by default.
  If iCloud sync is enabled, this data may be synced across your
  devices using Apple’s iCloud services.
  WanderWiki does not operate its own servers to store user content
  or reading data.

third_parties: >
  WanderWiki does not sell personal data and does not use
  third-party advertising networks or trackers.
  Content is retrieved from Wikipedia using publicly available APIs.
  Apple processes limited data as part of services you choose to use,
  such as iCloud sync, StoreKit purchases, push notifications,
  and device diagnostics.
  Any optional diagnostics are used only to improve app stability
  and core functionality and are collected in a minimized
  or aggregated form.

children: >
  WanderWiki is not intended for children under the age of 13,
  and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

changes: >
  We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
  Any changes will be reflected on this page,
  and the effective date will be updated accordingly.
