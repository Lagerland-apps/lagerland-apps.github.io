overview: >
  Driftlines is designed to be quiet and private.
  Most content is created and stored on your device,
  and we aim to collect as little data as possible.
  This policy explains what information Driftlines processes,
  how it is used, and the choices you have.

data_collection: >
  Driftlines processes the content you create in the app,
  such as persona configuration, daily Chronicle entries,
  and related in-app state.
  By default, this content is stored locally on your device.
  If you enable iCloud sync, content may be synced across your
  devices using Apple’s services.
  Driftlines may also process limited technical data related to
  app reliability, optional analytics, purchases,
  and features you explicitly enable.

data_storage: >
  App content is stored locally on your device by default.
  If iCloud sync is enabled, content is stored in your personal
  iCloud account and synced using Apple’s infrastructure.
  Driftlines does not operate its own servers to store
  Chronicle content or persona data.

third_parties: >
  Driftlines does not sell personal data and does not use
  third-party advertising networks.
  Apple processes limited data as part of services you choose
  to use, such as iCloud sync, StoreKit purchases,
  push notifications, and device diagnostics.
  If optional analytics or diagnostics are enabled,
  they are used only to improve reliability and core app flows
  and are collected in a minimized or aggregated form.

children: >
  Driftlines is not intended for children under the age of 13,
  and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

changes: >
  We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
  Any changes will be reflected on this page,
  and the effective date will be updated accordingly.
