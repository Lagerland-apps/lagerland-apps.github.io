title: "Privacy Policy"
app_name: "TheWait"

overview: >
  TheWait is designed to make waiting feel lighter through calm,
  minimal countdowns.
  Privacy is a core part of the experience.
  This policy explains what information TheWait processes,
  how it is used, and the choices you have.

data_collection: >
  TheWait processes the information you choose to enter into the app,
  such as event titles, dates, icons, themes, and optional notes.
  If you choose to add a photo to an event, TheWait accesses only the
  photo or photos you explicitly select using Apple’s system photo picker.
  If you enable weather for an event, you may optionally add a location
  (for example, a city) to retrieve a weather summary near the event date.
  TheWait does not track your real-time location and does not collect
  advertising identifiers.

data_storage: >
  Event data is stored locally on your device by default.
  Photos you select and any cached weather information are also stored
  on-device.
  If iCloud device backups are enabled, Apple may include app data
  in your personal iCloud backup according to your device settings.
  TheWait does not operate its own servers to store your event data.

third_parties: >
  TheWait does not use third-party advertising or tracking services.
  Apple processes limited data as part of services you choose to use,
  such as in-app purchases, local notifications, photo access,
  and iCloud backups.
  If weather information is enabled, requests may be sent to a
  weather data provider to return forecast information.
  These requests typically include approximate location information
  or a place identifier and standard technical data required for
  internet communication.

children: >
  TheWait is not directed at children under the age of 13,
  and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

changes: >
  We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
  Any changes will be reflected on this page,
  and the effective date will be updated accordingly.
