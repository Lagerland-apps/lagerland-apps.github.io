<!-- PROBLEM -->


<section class="section">
  <h2 class="h2">The problem coaches quietly deal with</h2>


  <div class="grid grid-2">
    <div class="card">
      <div class="card-title">PDF friction</div>
      <div class="card-text">
        Great programs lose momentum because delivery is clumsy: downloads,
        folders, instructions, and clients unsure what to do today.
      </div>
    </div>


<div class="card">
  <div class="card-title">Unnecessary messages</div>
  <div class="card-text">
    “Where do I find the workout?” “Which week am I on?”
    Not coaching — just friction caused by the format.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-title">Overbuilt platforms</div>
  <div class="card-text">
    Many coaching apps force dashboards, check-ins, analytics, and admin work
    you never asked for — and don’t want.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-title">Low follow-through</div>
  <div class="card-text">
    When starting feels complicated, clients delay.
    When they delay, they drop off — even with a good program.

<!-- FAQ -->


<section id="faq" class="section">
  <h2 class="h2">Coach FAQ</h2>


  <div class="faq">
    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary>Is this a full coaching platform?</summary>
      <div class="faq-a">
        No. GymLogger X intentionally avoids dashboards, client management,
        check-ins, and messaging. It focuses on program delivery and logging only.
      </div>
    </details>


<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can I track my clients inside GymLogger X?</summary>
  <div class="faq-a">
    No. Clients use the app independently.
    This keeps your workload low and the experience focused.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Do clients have to pay?</summary>
  <div class="faq-a">
    GymLogger X is free to use with optional paid features.
    Clients decide if they want Pro — you don’t need to sell it.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Does this replace PDFs completely?</summary>
  <div class="faq-a">
    Yes — that’s the point. Programs live inside the app,
    not as files clients forget or lose.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can I stop recommending it later?</summary>
  <div class="faq-a">
    Absolutely. No contracts, no lock-in.
    Recommend it only as long as it fits your coaching.
